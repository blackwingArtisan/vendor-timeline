# Wedding Vendor Timeline

> One sentence: who it helps and what the AI agent does with PayPal. <!-- TODO -->

## The problem

<!-- TODO: 3–5 sentences. Who has the problem, how often, what it costs them today (time, money, errors). Use a concrete example. -->

## What it does

<!-- TODO: The user journey in 4–6 bullets, from the user's point of view. Name the moment the agent acts and the moment a human approves. -->

## How PayPal is used

All PayPal calls go to the **sandbox** (`https://api-m.sandbox.paypal.com`); there is no live mode in the code. Every call shows on the in-app timeline with its HTTP status and PayPal `debug_id`.

| PayPal API | Endpoint(s) | Where and why |
|---|---|---|
| JS SDK v6 (buyer approval) | `web-sdk/v6/core`, `PayPalOneTimePaymentButton` | <!-- TODO --> |
| Orders v2 | `POST /v2/checkout/orders`, `/authorize`, `/capture` | <!-- TODO --> |
| Payments v2 | `/v2/payments/authorizations/{id}/capture`, `/void`, `/v2/payments/captures/{id}/refund` | <!-- TODO --> |
| Payouts | `POST /v1/payments/payouts` | <!-- TODO or delete row --> |
| Invoicing v2 | `/v2/invoicing/invoices`, `/send`, `/remind` | <!-- TODO or delete row --> |
| Disputes | `/v1/customer/disputes`, `/accept-claim`, `/provide-evidence` | <!-- TODO or delete row --> |
| Transaction Search | `GET /v1/reporting/transactions` | <!-- TODO or delete row --> |
| Webhooks | `POST /v1/notifications/verify-webhook-signature` | Verified webhooks update the app's ledger and trigger <!-- TODO --> |
| Vault v3 | `/v3/vault/setup-tokens`, `/payment-tokens` | <!-- TODO or delete row --> |
| **PayPal Agent Toolkit** | `@paypal/agent-toolkit` 1.11 tools: <!-- TODO list the ones your agent uses --> | The agent's PayPal tools come from PayPal's Agent Toolkit (definitions, validation and sandbox execution), extended with guarded tools the toolkit lacks (<!-- TODO e.g. capture_authorization, void_authorization -->). |

**Safety around money:** every money-moving agent call passes a guard. It enforces a per-action cap, a daily cap, a payee allowlist and idempotency (`PayPal-Request-Id`), and makes calls above <!-- TODO $50 --> wait for a human. Every decision goes to a hash-chained, append-only audit log.

## How AI is used

| Where | Model | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| <!-- TODO e.g. Settlement agent --> | Claude Haiku 5.5 (`claude-haiku-5-5`) | Plans the task and calls the PayPal tools in a loop; explains each step on the timeline |
| <!-- TODO e.g. Receipt reading --> | Claude Sonnet 5.5 (`claude-sonnet-5-5`) | Vision: extracts structured data from photos |
| <!-- TODO --> | | |

- **Agent loop**: Claude's tool use via the Anthropic TypeScript SDK (`@anthropic-ai/sdk`), with adaptive thinking and summarized reasoning shown on the timeline.
- **Structured output**: zod schemas through the Messages API's structured outputs (`output_config.format`).
- **Cost control**: a hard daily spend cap (worst case reserved before every call), per-IP rate limits, and Haiku by default.
- **Mock mode**: without an API key the app runs a clearly labelled scripted agent, so the demo works anywhere.

**Built with AI.** This project was built with **Claude Code** (Anthropic's coding agent), which wrote the code under human direction. It started from a shared starter kit that Claude Code also wrote. The product idea, scope and review were human decisions.

## Architecture

```
Browser (Next.js 16 / React 19, Tailwind, AG Grid)
  │  PayPal JS SDK v6 button ─────────────► PayPal sandbox checkout (buyer approval)
  │  SSE /api/events (live timeline)
  ▼
Next.js route handlers (Node)
  ├─ lib/paypal   typed PayPal client: sandbox REST (OAuth cache, PayPal-Request-Id, debug_id) or in-memory mock
  ├─ lib/agent    Claude tool-use loop → Guard (caps, allowlist, approvals, idempotency, audit) → tools
  │                 tools = PayPal Agent Toolkit 1.11 + guarded extensions
  ├─ lib/ai       Claude Haiku 5.5 / Sonnet 5.5: structured output, vision, streaming; daily spend cap
  ├─ webhooks     verify → ledger → handlers
  └─ .data/       local JSON: ledger, audit log, AI spend (mock PayPal state in mock mode)
```

<!-- TODO: add anything app-specific (other services, data sources). -->

## Run locally

Requirements: Node 24+ (developed on Node 26), npm.

```bash
npm ci
cp .env.example .env.local        # optional: values here override ../../.env.shared
PAYPAL_MODE=mock npm run dev      # no credentials needed
npm run seed                      # optional demo data
```

Open http://localhost:3000. For the real sandbox set `PAYPAL_MODE=sandbox`, `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID` and `PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET`. For real AI set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.

Checks: `npm run check` (lint, typecheck, unit tests, build), `npm run test:e2e`, `npm run test:sandbox`.

## Sandbox test accounts

1. In the PayPal Developer Dashboard → **Testing Tools → Sandbox Accounts**, use the default Personal (buyer) and Business (seller) accounts or create new ones.
2. Create a sandbox REST app under **Apps & Credentials → Sandbox** and copy its client ID and secret.
3. At checkout, log in with the **Personal** sandbox account (password on the account's details page).
4. Optional: add a webhook for `https://<your-deploy>/api/paypal/webhooks` and set `PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_ID`.

<!-- TODO: if judges should use a specific buyer account, give its email here (never a real account). -->

## Deploy

Render Blueprint (`render.yaml`): New → Blueprint → this repo, then enter the secrets in the dashboard.

## Limitations

- Sandbox only; no live payments are possible.
- Buyer approval in sandbox needs a sandbox buyer login, so automated tests cover that step in mock mode.
- Local JSON storage: data resets on redeploy (fine for a demo, not for production).
- Sandbox Transaction Search needs the reporting feature enabled on the PayPal app, and data can lag up to 3 hours; the app keeps its own ledger.
- The optional PayPal remote MCP connector is read-only and untested.
- <!-- TODO: app-specific limitations -->
